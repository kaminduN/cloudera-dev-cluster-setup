# vm.swappiness, is a value from 0-100 that controls the swapping of 
# application data (as anonymous pages) from physical memory to virtual memory on disk. 
# You can set the value of the vm.swappiness parameter for minimum swapping.
# Having a higher value of swappiness is not recommended for Hadoop servers 
# because it can cause lengthy Garbage collection pauses
# sudo sysctl vm.swappiness=10

#	 For older versions (that is, if --system does not work):

# Each Hadoop server will be having its own responsibility with multiple services (daemons) running on that. 
# All the servers will be communicating with each other in a frequent manner for various purposes.
# If all the communication happens between the daemons across different servers via the Firewall, it will be an extra burden to Hadoop. 
# So itâ€™s best practice to disable the firewall in the individual servers in Cluster.
# iptables-save > ~/firewall.rules
# systemctl stop firewalld
